#summary String and message encodings in Java

=Encodings=

==Convert a string from one encoding to another==
In some cases this is an easy and required step. For example, if we want to write special characters as name in an email address, its default encoding is `ISO-8859-1`, meanwhile the name can come from a database with an encoding of `UTF-8`.

This code snippet converts a string:
{{{
    final String utf8Message = "Some message containing special characters: éáíúűó";
    
    final String isoMessage  = new String( utf8Message.getBytes( "UTF-8" ), "ISO-8859-1" );
}}}
